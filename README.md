# emailScriptV2

Verison 2 of email script

I found that sending more than 100 emails using google's smtp locked out my account due to fears of my account being broken into - according to google anyways.

So after some research I found it's better to run emails through an outside API and that's when I found mailgun.

Set it up and it ran perfectly. I could import as many emails as I wanted to and send at the same time. Saving the company $$$ so I didn't have to write emails by hand anymore
